## What's JAMStack?

Good question! To many JAMStack is reminiscent of breakfast... ðŸ¥ž anyone? But in the world of tech we always love to create new terms for the latest and greatest.

JAMStack stands for:

**J**avascript

**A**PIs

**M**arkup

A combination of these three creates a powerful and simplistic way of building secure, dynamic and fast sites without the need of a server.
